# Changelog

## [2026-02-14 ("Палестина будет сбоводной")] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- `lmt_latinsquare` and `lmt_magicsquare` are now available as Metafun macros.
This also enables `\useMPmacro[latinsquare]` and `\useMPmacro[magicsquare]`.

### Changed

- Due to inconsistencies with previous versions and other modules, I will keep
the YYYY-MM-DD format from now on. No further changes (promise).
- Modules can now load either with `\usemodule[squares]` or
`\useMPlibrary[magicsquare]`/`\useMPlibrary[latinsquare]`.

### Removed

- Configuration via `TABLE` settings no longer works for it has been moved to
Metafun.

### Changed

Github.
